2. The Story (Draft)
a. The Emergence of the Orfina Porsche Design Watch
i. In 1972, Ferdinand Alexander “Butzi” Porsche, the visionary designer of
the Porsche 911 and grandson of the company’s founder, Ferdinand
Porsche, launched Porsche Design as an independent industrial design
studio.
ii. The origin of Porsche Design came when Butzi found himself along with
all other Porsche descendants - removed from executive roles at the
family company. The catalyst being Butzi’s father “Ferry” Porsche, son of
the company’s founder Ferdinand Porsche, becoming so exasperated by
the constant in-fighting with his sister Louise Piëch’s side of the family
that he decided to unilaterally strip all direct descendants of management
authority.
iii. Butzi, the man responsible for designing the legendary 911, immediately
responded by establishing the Porsche Design Studio - first in Stuttgart
and later in Zell am See, Austria. His first creation under the new banner
wasn’t a car or piece of furniture but a wristwatch - and not just any
wristwatch. It was the world’s first fully blacked-out chronograph, a radical
departure from the shiny steel and gold cases of the era.
iv. Guided by the same principles that defined the 911, Butzi envisioned a
timepiece inspired by the car’s gauge cluster. As he explained,
“My idea
was for the watch to match the design of the car - the 911 has a black
speedometer and tachometer in order not to blind the driver.
” His
philosophy was equally clear: “Design must be functional, and
functionality must be translated visually into aesthetics - without gags that
have to be explained first.
” This credo - often summarized as form follows
function - would define both Porsche Design and the watch itself.
v. Yet while Butzi had the vision and design, he needed a manufacturer.
That solution came through Umberto Maglioli, an Italian Formula One
driver who had raced for Ferrari, Maserati, and Porsche in the 1950s and,
fittingly, ended his career behind the wheel of a Porsche. Maglioli, who
had recently retired, purchased the Swiss watch manufacturer Orfina in
1970. Founded in the 1920s by Roland Ruefli, the company had
undergone several rebrandings - from Jorin SA to Finora Watch Co., and
finally, in 1947, to Montres Orfina.
vi. The partnership between Butzi Porsche’s design and Maglioli’s
manufacturing capabilities birthed the Porsche Design Chronograph One.
b. The Valjoux 7750 Era
i. The first iteration, the Reference 7750, featured a flat crystal, large
tachymeter bezel, and 30-minute and 12-hour counters, along with small
seconds and a quick-set day-date mechanism - the first of its kind in a
sports chronograph. True to its name, it was powered by the newly
introduced Valjoux 7750, a movement that would become one of the most
prolific automatic chronograph calibers in history. Although the
Chronograph One was officially launched in 1972, production models
began reaching customers in 1973 - making them among the earliest
watches in the world to use the 7750 movement. Unfortunately, the
Quartz Crisis soon struck, devastating the mechanical watch industry and
halting Valjoux 7750’s production only two years after its debut.
c. The Lemania 5100 Transition
i. Unwilling to compromise his belief in the mechanical chronograph, Butzi
Porsche turned to a new movement: the Lemania 5100. Introduced in the
mid 1970s, the 5100 was engineered for durability, reliability, and
affordability. With military, aviation, and tool-watch applications in mind,
the movement incorporated practical materials like Delrin plastic for
non-critical components and used a cam-and-shuttle system instead of
the more delicate column wheel. Thanks to its shock-absorbing Delrin
plate, the 5100 was the only chronograph caliber at the time that could
withstand vertical accelerations of up to 7 Gs without its central seconds
hand halting or losing accuracy - a quality that made it a favorite among
fighter pilots and military forces alike.
ii. With the new movement came a subtle redesign of the Chronograph One.
The 5100 introduced its signature central chronograph minutes and
seconds hands, improving readability during flight or racing. The watch
now featured a 12-hour totalizer at six o’clock, small seconds at nine, a
24-hour indicator at twelve, and continued the day-date display at three
o’clock. Two major references emerged - the Reference 7176 (civilian
version) and the Reference 7177 (military version).
iii. Production continued until 1991, when the Porsche Design-Orfina
partnership officially ended.
d. An Enduring Legacy
i. After 1991, Orfina continued producing similar models under the label
“Prestige Watch International” (PWI), often retaining the 7176 and 7177
reference engravings. Meanwhile, Porsche Design embarked on other
collaborations - first with IWC Schaffhausen in 1978, producing another
line of innovative watches, and later with Eterna in the 1990s.
ii. The Chronograph One cemented its place in cultural history through both
cinema and motorsport. It famously adorned the wrist of Pete “Maverick”
Mitchell (Tom Cruise) in Top Gun, and racing legend Mario Andretti - who
owned multiple, the first of which was stolen off his wrist while he slept on
a beach in Rio after the 1978 Rio Grand Prix. Other noted motorsport
wearers included Jürgen Barth, Gijs van Lennep, Hurley Haywood, and
Thierry Sabine, founder of the Paris–Dakar Rally (where the famed
Cartier Cheich was later born), and others.
iii. Among its most iconic admirers was Gianni Agnelli, the legendary Italian
industrialist and head of Fiat, who famously wore his Chronograph One
over his shirt cuff. Even in music, the watch found its way onto Jack
Douglas’s wrist, the legendary producer who worked with Patti Smith,
Miles Davis, and Cheap Trick, and was photographed wearing his the
same day John Lennon was captured at The Hit Factory with his Patek
Philippe 2499.

3. Overall Reference Guide
a. Overall
i. The story of the Orfina Porsche Design Chronograph One is one of
evolution - across movements, finishes, and eras but bound together by a
single partnership between Dr. Ferdinand Alexander “Butzi” Porsche and
Umberto Maglioli. Over nearly two decades, the partnership evolved
through three principal reference generations - each a response to the
changing landscape of watchmaking and design, and each maintaining
the spirit of Butzi’s original vision.
b. How to Use These Reference Pages
i. Each Reference Page in this archive is designed to operate both as a
collector’s guide and a historical record. Within each, you’ll find detailed
documentation of every major technical and design element that defines
the Chronograph One lineage:
1. Case & Finish Sections: outlining each case variation, available
finishes, and known case geometry.
2. Caseback Variations: cataloging engraving styles, manufacturer
markings, and serial ranges across production.
3. Rehaut Variations: comparing tachymeter scales, unit markings
(1Mile, 1km), and overall design differences.
4. Dial Variations: documenting each generation of printing,
typography, and issued markings/heritage.
c. Reference 7750
i. The Reference 7750 marks the genesis of the Chronograph One story -
the first black-coated chronograph ever produced and the original
embodiment of Porsche Design’s “form follows function” creed. It featured
a flat crystal, a very fitting large tachymeter, and was configured with
30-minute and 12-hour counters, a central and small seconds hand, as
well as a quick-set day and date mechanisms.
ii. As its name suggests, the reference was powered by the Valjoux 7750
movement. Unveiled in 1973 as Valjoux’s late entry into the automatic
chronograph race, the 7750 quickly became one of the most enduring
calibers in Swiss watchmaking. Although the Porsche Design
Chronograph One was officially launched in 1972, the first production
pieces reached customers by 1973. Despite its early success, the Vajloux
7750 movement production was abruptly halted just two years later amid
the Quartz Crisis, which devastated mechanical watch manufacturing.
iii. Within the 7750 lineage there exists -
1. Three Generations: (Generation 1, Generation 2, Generation 3)
2. Three Cases: (Mk. 1 - Flat Top, Mk. 2 - Transitional Round Top,
and Mk. 3 - Flat-Face a.k.a Service)
3. Three Finishes: (Powder Coat Black, Black PVD, and
Silver/Sablé)
4. Two Casebacks: (Mk. 1 and Mk .2)
5. Two Rehauts: (1Mile and 1km)
6. Two Dials: (Orfina and PD dials)
d. Reference 7176 and 7177
i. The Reference 7176 and 7177 represents the second major evolution of
the Chronograph One and the first to feature the Lemania 5100
movement. Introduced in the late 1970s, the Lemania 5100 was
purpose-built for durability, affordability, and ease of mass production.
With military, aviation, and tool-watch applications in mind, the movement
incorporated practical materials like Delrin plastic for non-critical
components and utilized a simplified cam and shuttle chronograph
mechanism. This transition required a complete redesign of the case
architecture, as the Lemania 5100 differed in both dimension and
structure from the 7750. The result was a taller and more robust case
profile.
ii. The Chronograph layout was updated to include the 5100’s distinctive
central chronograph minutes and seconds hands, alongside a 12-hour
totaliser at six o'clock, small seconds at nine o'clock, 24-hour display at
twelve o'clock, and continued day-date functions at three o'clock.
iii. Produced from the late 1970s through 1991 when Porsche Design ended
its partnership with Orfina, the 7176 and 7177 spanned the longest of any
Orfina Porsche Design reference. The Reference 7176 is seen as the
civilian version while the Reference 7177 is seen as the military version.
iv. Reference 7176 (Civilian Version)
1. Within the 7176 lineage there exists -
a. Four Generations: (7176, 7176 Military, 7176 D, and 7176
S)
b. One Case: (Standard)
c. Seven Finishes: (Black PVD, Silver/Sablé, Polished Steel,
Grey PVD, Olive Green PVD, Cadet Grey PVD, and NTS
PVD)
d. Four Casebacks: (Mk. 1, 7176 D, 7176 S, and Prototype)
e. Four Rehauts: (Yellow Triangle, TACHYMETRE, 1km, and
1Mile)
f. Six Dials: (Civilian, Civilian - Messy, Civilian - Short Lume,
Military, Blue by Orfina, and Black by Orfina)
v. Reference 7177 (Military Version)
1. The 7177 encompassed the widest range of issued models ever
associated with Orfina and Porsche Design. The 7177 was
available for retail purchase over the counter as well as issued
directly through military organizations, as evidenced by the
multiple military variants. However, these watches are often
considered quasi-issued as multiple variations were made
available to the public.
2. The 7177 military variants were identical to the civilian 7176
variant, including the case, except in five main ways - Available
Finishes, Caseback Engravings, Central Chronograph-Minutes
Hand and Hour Chronograph Hands, Rehaut, and Dial.
3. Within the 7177 lineage there exists -
a. Six Finishes: (Black PVD, Silver/Sablé, Cadet Grey PVD,
Olive Green PVD, NTS PVD, and Gold PVD - UAE Only)
b. Seven Casebacks: (Mk. 1, Mk. 2, BUND Singe-Struck,
BUND Double-Struck, EJERCITO DE VENEZUELA,
REPUBLICA DE VENEZUELA, and Mid-Caseback Serial)
c. Two Rehauts: (Crooked-Seven 12-hr, and Standard 12-hr)
d. 12 Dials: (Four-Logo, Baseline, Nato, Swiss Coat of Arms,
Military Chronograph, Service, Mk. 1 Flying Tiger, Mk. 2
Flying Tiger, Royal Navy, UAE Mk. 1, UAE Mk. 2, and by

5. Reference 7750 - Case & Finishes
a. There are three main case variations for the 7750
i. Orfina 7750 Flat Top – a.k.a Mk.1
ii. Orfina 7750 Transitional Round Top – a.k.a Mk. 2
iii. Orfina 7750 [FLAT-FACE - MODERN] - a.k.a Mk. 3 a.k.a Revised by
Orfina Swiss S.A
b. The three marks of the 7750 case were produced in a mix of Powder Coat Black,
Black PVD, and Silver/Sablé
c. 7750 Flat Top – a.k.a Mk. 1
i. The “Flat Top” / “Flat Face” is the case that started it all. The timeless
design of the Porsche Design Chronograph starts its story here. Dr.
Ferdinand Alexander “Butzi” Porsche’s initial design, which as legend has
it took inspiration from the gauges of the original 911 that he had
designed in 1963. Dr. Porsche’s credo was “Design must be functional
and functionality has to be translated visually into aesthetics, without gags
that have to be explained first.
” This is often stated as “form follows
function”
. With this visual translation from a 911’s gauges to a watch face
with a simple bezel surrounding it we see the rest of the case design
continue to follow this design principle. The height of the “flat” face (which
mimics the simple bezels of VDO gauges of the day) rises from the base
of the case just enough to fit the handset and rehaut. The overall body of
the case then extends out to provide a proper presence on the wrist and
include integrated hidden lugs. Because of the use of hidden lugs it could
be machined from a single block, adding rigidity and a very masculine and
sporty sensibility. The case geometry and dimensions are clean and
minimalist, lacking unnecessary flourishes or embellishments. This is the
birthplace of 50+ years of Porsche Design DNA.
ii. There are two finishes that were produced on the 7750 Mk.1 Case
1. Powder Coat Black - While black-coated watches are
commonplace today, in 1972 such a design was unprecedented.
The Chronograph One’s deep, matte-black case was so radical
that one period journalist quipped it was “a watch fit only for
funerals.
” Though often mistakenly believed to be the first black
PVD chronograph, the early Mk. 1 “Flat Top” cases were actually
powder-coated - finished with a thick black paint layer rather than
the later Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) technique. This coating,
while groundbreaking at the time, was notably thicker and more
prone to “flaking” than PVD.
a. Production Years: 1973-1975 (Tentative)

2. Silver/Sablé - Matte finished stainless steel.
a. NOTE: we don’t have an example of these. It’s possible
that Silver/Sablé only became available with the PD dials.
Thus, we are unsure of the exact timeline of the 7750 Mk.
1 Silver/Sablé, but one can assume they were made in a
similar timeline to that of the 7750 Mk. 1 Powder Coat
Black cases.

d. 7750 Transitional Round Top – a.k.a Mk. 2
i. In the mid-1970s, as a reaction to the Quartz Crisis, Valjoux halted
production and availability of the 7750 to most manufacturers, including
Orfina. Porsche Design & Orfina faced a dilemma about which movement
to transition to in order to continue producing their watches. Dr. Porsche
wanted to retain an automatic chronograph movement in his watch. This
led them to switch to the Lemania 5100. They designed a new case in
order to fit the dimensions of the new movement as it would not fit in the
existing 7750 cases. The new case would be used with the 7176 and
7177 models. Some cases were produced (whether the same case
vendor was used or not is unknown) with the new design, but thinned to fit
a Valjoux 7750, which Orfina still had some inventory of. Given the design
similarities, it is believed that these cases would date to later in 1975 -
1976.
ii. There are two finishes that were produced on the 7750 Mk. 2 case
1. Black PVD - Representing the first use of physical vapor
deposition (PVD) on a wristwatch. This pioneering technique
vaporized metal compounds and bonded them to the case
surface, creating a highly durable and uniform matte-black
coating.

, it has
a flat face. Orfina Swiss SA offers it as a replacement for original
damaged, or otherwise unusable cases as a modern replacement. These
cases feature a larger crown as the replacement crown produced for
Orfina Swiss SA is larger than the originals and restores the
water-resistance of the watch. This case also features larger pushers and
mortices milled to fit the larger crown and pushers.

7. Reference 7750 - Rehaut Variations
a. There are three known variations of Rehaut found in the 7750 model range.
These can be found across all 7750 case marks and dial variations.
b. An interesting comparison is that despite being different measurements, the
1Mile and 1km have the same marks throughout their rehaut. This lack of detail
might explain that in the next reference of Orfina Porsche Design watches, the
manufacturer just put "Tachymetre" solely on the rehaut without either “unit”
designation.
i. 1Mile
1. The 1Mile rehaut features tachymetric markings calibrated for
mile-based measurements, commonly used in markets following
imperial measurement systems.

a. All 7176 variants feature a “Round Top” / “Round Face” outfitted to fit the, at the
time, new Lemania 5100 movement. The round nature of this case is seen as a
direct evolution of the 7750 Mk. 2 case, but it is thicker to accommodate the taller
new movement.

most commonly observed on civilian dials, particularly those with a
“messy” Porsche Design signature. While it is established that
such 7176 S variants with civilian “messy” dials and 1km rehauts
do exist, additional examples are needed to confirm this with
greater certainty and to better define the scope of their production.

14. Reference 7177
a. The 7177 Military Chronograph was introduced in 1977 and was likely produced
until 1991, when Porsche Design ended its partnership with Orfina.
Subsequently, the “Prestige Watch International” signed pieces emerged.
b. The 7177 was available for retail purchase over the counter as well as issued
directly through military organizations, as evidenced by the multiple military
variants. However, these watches are often considered quasi-issued as the
Baseline military dial was made available to the public to capitalize on the
potential military affiliation.
c. There are ten main 7177 or military variants. These variants each feature some
of the dial elements noted on the Baseline dial but have additional dial printing,
and/or caseback engravings unique to each.
d. The 7177 military variants were identical to the civilian 7176 variant, including the
case, except in five main ways:

a. General Notes:
i. The BUND variant is short for "Bundeswehr"
, the German Federal
Defense Force to whom they were issued.
ii. BUND examples are seen in a variety of finishes and were always issued
on a BUND-style strap.
b. Caseback Markings:
i. On these examples, the caseback does have "BUND" and an appropriate
NSN engraving.
ii. Two known NSNs are found on the BUND variant: the initial NSN is
6645-12-182-1763, and the second is 6645-12-194-8642.
iii. Some BUND examples are "double-struck,
" meaning the initial NSN is
crossed out, and the second NSN is added. This was presumably done at
some maintenance event during the watch’s lifetime. BUND variants also
do not have the "7177" ref# engraving on the caseback.

c. Dial Variations:
i. BUND examples have been found to be produced with both the Baseline
Dial and the Military Chronograph Dial.
ii. Military Chronograph Dial: Lacked the baseline dial’s “Porsche Design”
text, which was replaced with “CHRONOGRAPH” text.
iii. Service Dial: Some BUND examples sent in for service, had their dials
replaced with Service Dials. These used early Luminova and lacked
“Porsche Design” text, again replaced by “CHRONOGRAPH” text, but
also lacked the “3H” marking because the dials did not use tritium.
Luminova dial examples will also bear double-struck casebacks.

a. General Notes:
i. The Venezuelan-issued watches were produced for the Venezuelan
Ministry of Defense (VZMOD).

they were worn extensively throughout their service careers.
iii. Examples of the Venezuela variant are known to come in multiple finishes
and were delivered with a unique printed box.
b. Caseback Markings:
i. The Venezuelan variant watches are known to come in two batches, one

25. Reference 7177 - Flying Tiger Dial
a. History
i. The Flying Tiger Watches were Issued for the U.S. Air Force’s 23rd
Tactical Fighter Group.
ii. The 23rd Fighter Group is the home of the Air Force's legendary Flying
Tigers and is stationed at Moody Air Force Base. The 23rd Fighter
Group's primary mission is forward air control, close-air support,
interdiction, and combat search and rescue operations.
iii. The 23rd Fighter Group traces its roots back to the 23rd Pursuit Group,
which was formed on December 17, 1941, just 10 days after the
Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The group had three squadrons
assigned to carry out their mission: the 74th, 75th, and 76th Fighter
Squadrons.
iv. A particularly interesting note is that the aircraft assigned to the group has
the unique "Shark Teeth" nose art. The Flying Tigers are the only Air
Force unit authorized to carry this distinctive and historical aircraft
marking.
b. Dial Variations
i. The Flying Tiger watches were produced in two batches:
1. Mk. 1 Flying Tiger Dial: Featuring both the “U.S. Air Force”
inscription and the Flying Tiger logo.
2. Mk. 2 Flying Tiger Dial: Retaining the Flying Tiger logo but omitting
the “U.S. Air Force” inscription.
ii. The casebacks of both variants were identical to those of the baseline
7177. Most examples were finished in Silver/Sablé, Black PVD, or NTS
PVD.

26. Reference 7177 - Royal Navy Dial
a. General Notes:
i. The Royal Navy variant has two debated origins.
1. Theory 1: Quasi-Issued - the first is that these are quasi-issued
and were not issued to NATO stock, as they lack the traditional
caseback broad arrow marking and any typical MOD markings.
2. Theory 2: Issued - the other theory is that they were, in fact,
issued to NATO stock but only a small number for evaluation by
the Royal Navy - all of which were marked and issued with a
NATO stock code on their caseback.
b. Distinguishing Characteristics:
i. Royal Navy Dial: The dial of this variant bears the inscription “Royal Navy”
below the PORSCHE DESIGN text at 3 o'clock.
ii. Finishes: It is believed that most, if not all, were produced in Silver/Sablé,
but examples have been seen in an NTS PVD case.
iii. Bracelet: Royal Navy examples are commonly found, with an Orfina
signed “lobster” bracelet instead of the standard NSA bracelet.

a. General Notes:
i. Both of the UAE dial variants came in a variety of the 7177 finishes.
Interestingly, a small batch of circa ~25 watches featuring gold-colored
cases were produced.
b. Caseback:
i. There is a very small batch of casebacks in which the serial number's
location shifted to the middle of the caseback. This is found on UAE
issued examples, in the low ~3000 serial range.
c. Dial Variations:
i. The 7177 UAE variant was ordered by the UAE’s Air Force and came in
two dial variations:
ii. UAE Mk. 1 Dial: Stamped with “UAE AIR FORCE” at four o'clock and a
tricolor motif at the six o’clock subdial.
iii. UAE Mk. 2 Dial: Stamped with “UAE AIR FORCE” at four o'clock as well,
but “CENTRAL AIR BASE" stamped at the six o’clock subdial instead of a
motif.

32. Components - Crowns
a. There are a variety of crowns found across the Orfina Porsche Design references
b. 7750 Crown
i. General Notes:
1. The 7750 is 5.4mm in diameter.
2. The crown is marked with the Orfina Flame logo or PD logo.
3. The crowns on 7750 units are not screw-downs, their ability to
maintain water resistance comes from an integrated gasket built
into the crown creating a seal. These gaskets deteriorate over
time, requiring replacement. They have been out of production for
many years, and suitable replacements that would retain water
resistance are not available. For this reason, these watches
should not be considered water-resistant today and should be

cared for accordingly. Also, original-size crowns for these units
with the Orfina logo are not available, only with PD logos.
4. As mentioned previously, Orfina 7750 [FLAT-FACE - Service] -
a.k.a Mk. 3 a.k.a Revised by Orfina Swiss S.A. is offered by Orfina
Swiss SA as a replacement to original damaged or otherwise
unusable cases as a modern replacement. It uses a larger Orfina
signed crown and restores the water-resistant rating of the watch.

CROWNS from Orfina Schifferle. They were swapped in the
course of a service and were produced by Orfina because they
ran out of PD crowns and were not allowed to re-produce
PD-crowns because the contract with PD had expired. Therefore
Orfina flame logo crowns can be found on Orfina-serviced

33. Components - Movements
a.
“The best car analogy I can find is the Valjoux 7750 and the Lemania 5100 are
the Chevy 350 and the Ford 351-C of watches. Both are tried and true designs,
nigh bulletproof when treated with a modicum of care, with outstanding parts
availabilty and as common as dirt.
”
- Chuck
b. Valjoux 7750
i. General Notes:
1. Unveiled in 1973, the Valjoux 7750 is one of the most iconic and
enduring automatic chronograph movements in Swiss
watchmaking. Developed by Valjoux, it was designed to be robust,
reliable, and easier to mass-produce than its column-wheel
predecessors like the Valjoux 72. In reaction to the proliferation of
the Chronomatic Cal. 11/12/15’s and the JRGK version of said,
Valjoux was losing market share in their wholesale business
because their 773x movement line was still handwound. The
market wanted automatic chronographs and Valjoux quickly
developed the 7750 as an evolution to the 7734. Using Computer
Aided Design (CAD) for the first time in the industry, the 7750 was
designed quickly to be mass-produced and serve as the new
workhorse movement.
2. The original 1973 version of the movement had 17 Jewels, and it
includes a quick-set day and date mechanism and supports
chronograph functions with a central seconds hand, 30-minute
and 12-hour counters, and small seconds.
3. Despite a promising start, production of the 7750 was halted just
two years after launch due to the quartz crisis, which devastated
the mechanical watch industry. However, the movement saw a
revival in the 1980s as the market rebounded, and it has since
become a workhorse for countless brands, from TAG Heuer and
IWC to Tudor and Sinn.
ii. Valjoux 7750 Rotors:
1. Marked “ORFINA WATCH LTD SWISS” in two lines with “SWISS”
engraved below “ORFINA WATCH LTD” filling the lower part of an
insert surrounding the central bushing.
2. The rotor is known to exist in 2 finishes, with the earliest examples
being a simple brushed metal unit. These were followed by a
guilloche-finished insert that began being used during the Orfina
dial period and would continue to be used until the end of 7750
model production.

c. Lemania 5100
i. General Notes:
1. Introduced in 1974, the Lemania 5100 stands out as one of the
most utilitarian and function-driven automatic chronograph
movements of its era. Developed by Lemania during a time when
the mechanical watch industry was being battered by the quartz
crisis, the 5100 was purpose-built for durability, affordability, and
ease of mass production. With military, aviation, and tool-watch
applications in mind, the movement incorporated practical
materials like Delrin plastic for non-critical components and utilized
a simplified cam and shuttle chronograph mechanism - favoring
reliability over visual refinement.
2. The movement featured 17 jewels, and a 48-hour power reserve.
What made the 5100 especially distinctive was its central
chronograph minutes and seconds hands, allowing for instant
readability - alongside a 12-hour totaliser at six o'clock, small
seconds at nine o'clock, 24-hour display at twelve o'clock, and
day-date function at three o'clock.
3. Militaries have strict standards for any issued equipment - it must
be functional, cost-efficient, and robust. The Lemania 5100
checked all three boxes. To enhance durability, Lemania added
structural supports on either side of the movement, increasing its
shock resistance. Uniquely, the 5100’s chronograph seconds hand
used a direct-drive system, rather than the more common
intermediary wheel - eliminating a point of failure. This made the
movement virtually immune to shock-induced stoppage under all
but the most extreme conditions. In fact, it was famously capable
of withstanding up to 7 Gs of force without its chronograph hand
halting, earning it a place in fighter jets, cockpits, and
military-issue watches.
4. Although never lauded for finishing or aesthetic beauty, the
Lemania 5100 earned a cult following for its bulletproof
engineering. It was used by brands like Sinn, Bell & Ross, Fortis,
Tutima, Heuer, and Omega. Production ended in 2002 after
Swatch Group absorbed Lemania, but the 5100 remains a
benchmark of functionality-driven design and one of the most
respected "tool watch" movements ever made.
ii. Movement Serial Numbers:
1. There are two different types of serial numbers seen across the
7176 and 7177 References.
a. The earlier movement serial is a circle that is embedded in
the watch movement, where a sticker displays the
movement’s serial.
b. Provided Serial: 4049628
