These gaskets deteriorate over time, requiring replacement. They have been out of production for many years, and suitable replacements that would retain water resistance are not available. For this reason, these watches should not be considered water-resistant today and should be cared for accordingly. Also, original-size crowns for these units with the Orfina logo are not available, only with PD logos."

It uses a larger Orfina signed crown and restores the water-resistant rating of the watch."
