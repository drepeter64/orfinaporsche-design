Developed by Valjoux, it was designed to be robust,\nreliable, and easier to mass-produce than its column-wheel\npredecessors like the Valjoux 72. In reaction to the proliferation of\nthe Chronomatic Cal. 11/12/15’s and the JRGK version of said,\nValjoux was losing market share in their wholesale business\nbecause their 773x movement line was still handwound. The\nmarket wanted automatic chronographs and Valjoux quickly\ndeveloped the 7750 as an evolution to the 7734. Using Computer\nAided Design (CAD) for the first time in the industry, the 7750 was\ndesigned quickly to be mass-produced and serve as the new\nworkhorse movement."

With military, aviation, and tool-watch\napplications in mind, the movement incorporated practical\nmaterials like Delrin plastic for non-critical components and utilized\na simplified cam and shuttle chronograph mechanism - favoring\nreliability over visual refinement."

To enhance durability, Lemania added\nstructural supports on either side of the movement, increasing its\nshock resistance. Uniquely, the 5100’s chronograph seconds hand\nused a direct-drive system, rather than the more common\nintermediary wheel - eliminating a point of failure. This made the\nmovement virtually immune to shock-induced stoppage under all\nbut the most extreme conditions. In fact, it was famously capable\nof withstanding up to 7 Gs of force without its chronograph hand\nhalting, earning it a place in fighter jets, cockpits, and\nmilitary-issue watches."
