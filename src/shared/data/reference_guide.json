      "description": "The Reference 7750 marks the genesis of the Chronograph One story — the first black-coated chronograph ever produced and the original embodiment of Porsche Design's \"form follows function\" creed. It featured a flat crystal, a very fitting large tachymeter, and was configured with 30-minute and 12-hour counters, a central and small seconds hand, as well as a quick-set day and date mechanisms.",
      "details": "As its name suggests, the reference was powered by the Valjoux 7750 movement. Unveiled in 1973 as Valjoux's late entry into the automatic chronograph race, the 7750 quickly became one of the most enduring calibers in Swiss watchmaking. Although the Porsche Design Chronograph One was officially launched in 1972, the first production pieces reached customers by 1973. Despite its early success, the Valjoux 7750 movement production was abruptly halted just two years later amid the Quartz Crisis, which devastated mechanical watch manufacturing.",

    "description": "The Reference 7176 and 7177 represents the second major evolution of the Chronograph One and the first to feature the Lemania 5100 movement. Introduced in the late 1970s, the Lemania 5100 was purpose-built for durability, affordability, and ease of mass production. With military, aviation, and tool-watch applications in mind, the movement incorporated practical materials like Delrin plastic for non-critical components and utilized a simplified cam and shuttle chronograph mechanism. This transition required a complete redesign of the case architecture, as the Lemania 5100 differed in both dimension and structure from the 7750. The result was a taller and more robust case profile.",
    "details": "The Chronograph layout was updated to include the 5100's distinctive central chronograph minutes and seconds hands, alongside a 12-hour totaliser at six o'clock, small seconds at nine o'clock, 24-hour display at twelve o'clock, and continued day-date functions at three o'clock.",
    "details2": "Produced from the late 1970s through 1991 when Porsche Design ended its partnership with Orfina, the 7176 and 7177 spanned the longest of any Orfina Porsche Design reference. The Reference 7176 is seen as the civilian version while the Reference 7177 is seen as the military version."
