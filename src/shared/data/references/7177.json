      "The 7177 Military Chronograph was introduced in 1977 and was likely produced until 1991, when Porsche Design ended its partnership with Orfina. Subsequently, the \"Prestige Watch International\" signed pieces emerged.",
      "The 7177 was available for retail purchase over the counter as well as issued directly through military organizations, as evidenced by the multiple military variants.

      "There are ten main 7177 or military variants. These variants each feature the three dial elements noted on the Baseline dial (having \"MILITARY\", \"PORSCHE DESIGN\", and the \"circle-3H logo\" printed on the dial) but have additional dial printing, and/or caseback engravings unique to each.",
      "The 7177 military variants were identical to the civilian 7176s variant, including the case, except in five main ways:"
