    "All 7176 variants feature a “Round Top” / “Round Face” outfitted to fit the, at the time, new Lemania 5100 movement. The round nature of this case is seen as a direct evolution of the 7750 Mk. 2 case, but it is thicker to accommodate the taller new movement.",

      "description": "The Black PVD (Physical Vapor Deposition) finish represents the signature aesthetic of the 7176 series. This matte-black coating was applied using the same pioneering PVD technique first used on the 7750 Mk. 2, creating a highly durable and uniform finish that became synonymous with Porsche Design's minimalist industrial aesthetic.\n\nThe deep, matte-black appearance eliminates reflections and glare, making it ideal for both civilian and military applications. This finish was available across all 7176 variants, making it one of the most common and recognizable finishes for the reference.",
